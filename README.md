# blockchain-simulation

A Python3 program for simulating a horrendously simplified blockchain that uses PoW algorithm.

### What is included:
- Shortest path routing (static) using Dijkstra
- Probabilistic model for mining the blocks
- Various plots based on the data generated by the simulation

### What is not included:
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment as in Bitcoin etc
- Cases where blocks are simultaneously mined by multiple miners, and the resolution of such scenarios (for example, by "longest chain always wins")

### Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib
- anything else that Python3 might cry about while running

### How to run
- If you're lazy and don't want to supply the rather large number of inputs, feel free to use indirection from *sample_input*.
